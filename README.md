Hi! This is a card based memory game with parrots I'm building using what I'm learning about web development at Driven bootcamp!
Also using it to learn more about and to practice git and github!

CHANGELOG:

0.3 - added card turning functionality based on card click
      added placeholder text on their back sides

0.2 - added option to choose amount of cards to play between 4 and 14, for a total of 2 to 7 pairs
      layout now changes to show cards based on the chosen amount

0.1 - first commit - added the requested layout
