Hi! This is a card based memory game with parrots I'm building using what I'm learning about web development at Driven bootcamp!
Also using it to learn more about and to practice git and github!

CHANGELOG:

1.0.1 - small, overdue fix implemented to conform to request
        time wrong cards stay turned reduced from 2 to 1 second

1.0 - further testing, final version released

0.8 - removed snippets of code for debugging purposes
      fixed small bug the timer would stay atop the title on the mobile view

0.7 - fixed a game breaking bug when multiple cards are selected one after the other in a short time

0.6 - added timer, a requested functionality bonus, it will start after the first card is turned and stop after all cards are turned
      added the option to restart the game, a requested functionality bonus, which reloads the page

0.5 - game itself implemented! test your memory choosing from 4 to 14 cards and trying to match the funny parrots in the smallest number of clicks possible!
      your score will be shown in an alert pop-up when you finish!

0.4 - added final front card design
      different pair of parrot gifs will be randomly given to all cards in the game

0.3 - added card turning functionality based on card click
      added placeholder text on their back sides

0.2 - added option to choose amount of cards to play between 4 and 14, for a total of 2 to 7 pairs
      layout now changes to show cards based on the chosen amount

0.1 - first commit - added the requested layout
